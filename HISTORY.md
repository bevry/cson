-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v5.1.0 2018 January 25

-   Revert CSON's use of CoffeeScript v2, as it [broke support for Node 4 and below](https://travis-ci.org/bevry/cson/builds/333130290)
-   Use of CoffeeScript v2 is now limited to compilation of this project only

## v5.0.0 2018 January 25

-   Now uses CoffeeScript v2
-   Now uses [editions](https://github.com/bevry/editions) to use the ESNext compiled edition for environments that support it, otherwise use the ES2015 compiled edition
-   Updated base files

## v4.1.0 2017 April 10

-   `cson2json` and `json2cson` will now output the error if the input file is invalid
    -   Closes [issue #78](https://github.com/bevry/cson/issues/78)
-   Updated base files

## v4.0.0 2016 October 20

-   `parseCSString` no longer creates the `sandbox` variable if it was missing, the responsibility of such things should be, and now is, handled via the eval function of coffeescript which is what that method uses - This is a major breaking change as parsing coffeescript files will now by default run still in a virtual machine but now in the global context rather than their own context - If you are parsing untrusted coffeescript files, you should now setup the `sandbox` option yourself with the appropriate values - If you are parsing trusted coffeescript files, or not parsing coffeescript files (e.g. only CSON files), then this change won't impact you - This change is done such that the result object from `parseCSString` passes `result.__proto__ === Object.prototype` which before it did not as the different context caused the prototype to point to a different contexts `Object` causing the assertion to fail
-   Updated dependencies
-   Updated internal packing conventions

## v3.0.2 2015 September 18

-   Updated dependencies
